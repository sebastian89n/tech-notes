In a pipeline job definition, environment variables can be configured to store values that your jobâ€™s steps can reuse without hardcoding them. In Jenkins Declarative Pipeline, you can define them globally under the `environment` block so they are available to all stages, or you can define them inside a specific stage so they only apply there.

**Global example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        APP_ENV = 'production'
        DB_URL = credentials('db-connection')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo Environment: $APP_ENV'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Stage-scoped example:**
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            environment {
                BUILD_MODE = 'debug'
            }
            steps {
                sh 'echo Build mode: $BUILD_MODE'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo No BUILD_MODE here unless redefined'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Variables defined in the `environment` block are available to all stages, while stage-level `environment` blocks only affect that stage. In Scripted Pipeline, you can set them using `env.VARIABLE_NAME = 'value'`. For sensitive values, use Jenkins Credentials and reference them in the `environment` block instead of hardcoding.
