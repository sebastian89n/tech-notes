The **HTML Publisher plugin** in Jenkins allows you to publish HTML reports generated during your build process as part of the job's build results. It's commonly used for displaying test coverage reports, custom dashboards, or any other static HTML content. Once configured, the plugin makes the reports easily accessible through a "Report" link on the job or build page.

The **Jenkins Blue Ocean** plugin is a modern, user-friendly UI for Jenkins that simplifies the visualization and management of Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines. It provides an intuitive graphical interface for creating, editing, and monitoring pipelines defined in Jenkinsfiles. Blue Ocean aims to improve developer experience by making complex build processes easier to understand and debug. 
**Note:** this plugin doesn't seem to be supported anymore and aside from better pipeline visualisations doesn't seem to offer match. There are a lot of additional plugins installed together with this one.
