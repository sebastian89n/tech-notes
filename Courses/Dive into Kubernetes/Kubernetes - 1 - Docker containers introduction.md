### Introduction to Docker Containers

##### What Are Docker Containers?

**Docker containers** are a way to package and run applications in isolated environments. A container includes everything needed to run the application: code, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files.

Containers make applications **portable**, **consistent across environments**, and **lightweight** compared to traditional virtual machines.

### Docker Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs)

| Feature          | Docker Containers                         | Virtual Machines                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Isolation**    | Process-level (via Linux kernel features) | Full hardware-level (via hypervisor) |
| **Startup Time** | Fast (milliseconds)                       | Slow (minutes)                       |
| **Size**         | Lightweight (MBs)                         | Heavyweight (GBs)                    |
| **Performance**  | Near-native                               | Some overhead from the guest OS      |
| **Guest OS**     | Shares host OS kernel                     | Includes full guest OS               |

#### Example

- **VM**: Runs an entire operating system (e.g., Ubuntu), including its own kernel.
- **Container**: Runs an app with only its required libraries and dependencies, using the host's kernel.

### How Do Containers Work Under the Hood?

Containers rely on Linux kernel features that allow them to behave like lightweight, isolated virtual systems without the need for a full OS.

#### 1. **Namespaces** – Isolation

Namespaces provide isolation between containers and the host or other containers. Each container gets its own isolated view of system resources:

- **PID namespace** – Isolates process IDs.
- **NET namespace** – Isolates network interfaces, IP addresses, routing tables.
- **UTS namespace** – Isolates host and domain names.
- **MNT namespace** – Isolates file system mount points.
- **IPC namespace** – Isolates inter-process communication (semaphores, message queues).
- **USER namespace** – Isolates user and group IDs.

This makes each container appear like it is running on its own OS.

#### 2. **Control Groups (cgroups)** – Resource Management

**Cgroups** (Control Groups) allow the kernel to limit, prioritize, and isolate resource usage per container:

- **CPU** – Limit how much CPU time a container can use.
- **Memory** – Cap memory usage and trigger out-of-memory behavior.
- **Block I/O** – Limit disk I/O throughput.
- **Network** – (via additional tools) manage bandwidth.

### Summary

Docker containers are:
- **Lightweight** – no need for a full OS.
- **Fast** – start up in milliseconds.
- **Isolated** – each container is sandboxed using kernel features.
- **Portable** – works the same in dev, staging, and production.

These advantages make Docker a core tool in modern development and deployment workflows, especially in microservices, CI/CD, and cloud-native environments.

`docker run -it ubuntu bash`
`apt update`
`apt install htop`

You can configure Resources in Settings->Resources in Docker desktop.
You can also enable Kubernetes in the Settings.

`kubectl get nodes`

### Docker originally relies on Linux kernel features:

Docker containers are fundamentally built on **Linux kernel features**:
- **Namespaces**: for isolation (processes, networking, mount points, etc.)
- **Cgroups**: for resource limits
- **UnionFS** (like OverlayFS): for layered filesystems
- **Capabilities and seccomp**: for restricting container privileges

Docker can run **native Windows containers** using Windows kernel features (like Job Objects and Windows namespaces). But this is **only** for containers built on **Windows base images** (not Linux ones).

Docker Desktop on Windows used **Hyper-V** to run a tiny Linux VM (based on Alpine or Debian) and ran all containers inside that VM. Now it uses **WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)**, which provides a **real Linux kernel** inside a lightweight VM.
