# tech-notes

A personal collection of technical notes, learning resources, and reference material.  
This vault is primarily used to document knowledge gained from hands-on experience, Udemy courses, tutorials, and daily work in software development.

## Purpose

This repository serves as my digital notebook for:

- Summarizing concepts learned in online courses (e.g., Udemy)
- Taking structured notes on programming languages, frameworks, tools, etc.
- Storing command-line snippets, configs, and quick how-tos
- Writing down debugging steps and gotchas I've encountered
- Creating personal cheat sheets and templates

---

## Tools

This vault is managed using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a markdown-based note-taking tool.  
Optionally version-controlled using Git to:

- Track changes over time
- Backup notes to a private or public Git repo
- Sync across devices (e.g., laptop and desktop)
